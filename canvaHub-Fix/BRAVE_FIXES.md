# Brave Browser Fixes Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Brave Compatibility:

### 1. Manifest.json Changes:
- **Removed `"type": "module"`** from service worker (Brave has issues with ES modules)
- **Limited content script to Canva only**: `"matches": ["*://*.canva.com/*"]`
- **Added `"run_at": "document_idle"`** for better loading timing
- **Limited host permissions** to `"*://*.canva.com/*"` instead of all URLs
- **Updated web_accessible_resources** to be more specific

### 2. Content Script Improvements:
- **Added delay for image detection** (100ms) to account for Brave's slower loading
- **Enhanced image detection** to include `data-src` and `data-original` attributes
- **Better filtering** for Canva images (includes lazy-loaded images)
- **More robust error handling**

### 3. Popup Script Enhancements:
- **Increased timeout** from 10s to 15s for Brave
- **Better error messages** specifically mentioning Brave Shields
- **Enhanced content script injection** with multiple retry attempts
- **Fallback injection method** with inline function execution
- **Specific Brave browser detection**

### 4. Background Script Updates:
- **Installation handler** to detect Brave and provide guidance
- **Better timeout handling** 
- **More robust error recovery**

### 5. Debugging Tools Added:
- **brave-diagnostic.js**: Comprehensive diagnostic script
- **BRAVE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md**: Step-by-step troubleshooting guide
- **Enhanced logging** throughout all scripts

## How to Test:

1. **Reload the extension** in Brave
2. **Go to canva.com** and open any design
3. **Disable Brave Shields** for canva.com if needed
4. **Open Developer Tools** and check for `[CanvaHub]` messages
5. **Click the extension icon** and try "Extract Images"

## If Still Not Working:

1. **Run the diagnostic**: Copy-paste `brave-diagnostic.js` in console
2. **Check Brave Shields**: Make sure they're disabled for canva.com
3. **Verify permissions**: Extension should have access to canva.com
4. **Try incognito mode**: Sometimes helps with extension conflicts

The main issue was likely Brave's aggressive blocking of content scripts and the ES module service worker type.
