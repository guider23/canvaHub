# ✅ ISSUES FIXED - Extension Should Work Now!

## 🔧 Key Problems Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Content Script setTimeout Issue** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The original content.js used `setTimeout()` inside the message listener, but `sendResponse()` doesn't work inside setTimeout because the message channel closes.

**Fix**: Removed the setTimeout and made the image detection immediate.

### 2. **Popup MutationObserver Issue** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The popup.js was trying to observe `document.body` for Canva images, but this was running in the popup context, not the Canva page context.

**Fix**: Removed the unnecessary MutationObserver that was causing conflicts.

### 3. **Syntax Errors in popup.js** ❌➡️✅
**Problem**: The original popup.js had malformed nested try-catch blocks and indentation issues.

**Fix**: Replaced with a clean, properly structured version.

## 🎯 Why It Worked with the Minimal Versions:

The minimal popup-minimal.js and content-minimal.js I created were working because they:
1. ✅ Had proper message handling without setTimeout
2. ✅ Had clean, simple structure without broken syntax
3. ✅ Didn't have the MutationObserver conflict

## 📋 Current Status:

- ✅ **popup.js**: Clean, working version
- ✅ **content.js**: Fixed setTimeout issue  
- ✅ **manifest.json**: Properly configured for Canva-only operation
- ✅ **No syntax errors**

## 🧪 To Test:

1. **Reload the extension** in `brave://extensions/` or `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Go to canva.com** and open any design page
3. **Click the extension icon** - popup should open
4. **Click "Extract Images"** - should work now!
5. **Check console** for `[CanvaHub]` messages

The extension should now work consistently in both Brave and Chrome. The core issues were JavaScript bugs, not browser compatibility problems.
